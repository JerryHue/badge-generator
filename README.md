## Project website

[![Github Pages site](https://img.shields.io/badge/Github_Pages-Badge_Generator-green?style=for-the-badge)](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/badge-generator/)


## Contributing

- Create an issue to request a feature.
- Submit a PR to add an improvement.


## Development

### Notes

- The markdown files get styling added on Github and are kept light here without Jekyll theming for now.
- The badge generator HTML file has no frontmatter, so the brackets are not parsed at build time, leaving them to be processed by mustache.
- Dependencies are loaded in the HTML to keep the built process light for now.
