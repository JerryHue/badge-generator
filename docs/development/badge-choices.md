# Badge choices


## Badges about repos

I like the counters for stars and forks.

Later I added support for issue count.

The other things  aren't worth measuring.

Contributor count can be handled by listing contributors in the README - a bot helps with this. Or the builtin contributor view on GitHub on the side panel.

Commit activity wasn't reliable. Too often the badge for commit count (yearly, monthly and daily) gave an error.
