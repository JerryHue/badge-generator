> How to maintain this project's dependencies

## Outdated

Check outdated plugins:

```sh
$ npx vue outdated
```

Outdated packages:

```sh
$ yarn outdated
```

## Upgrade

Leave off a version number to get the latest.

```sh
$ yarn add foo
```

That will use the high available, without conflicting with extant packages.
