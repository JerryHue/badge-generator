## GitHub Badge Generator

It is similar in terms of input and output, but built is on React.

- https://badges.amercier.com
- https://github.com/amercier/badge-generator#github-badge-generator

Also it uses checkboxes around a repo, while my project generates most badges for you and you can pick what you want to use.

It also offers choices of badge styles and a choice for output (Markdown, etc.) which isn't so useful for me to add.

The design and structure as partly influenced by this project.
