> Online tool to help you quickly generate tailor-made badges/shields for your repo docs and learn to work with badges


## Features

- Quickly and easily generate badges
- Preview your badges and then copy the markdown when you're happy
- Uses dynamic SVG images defined by URL - no image editing
- Professional and consistent badges
- Use pre-made generic badges or create a new one


## Menu

- [Badge templates](badges) - tutorial and examples
- [Badge generator](badge_generator) - your details go in, custom badges come out for you to copy

If you are interested in choosing a license for your repo, see [Licenses cheatsheet](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/cheatsheets/blob/master/cheatsheets/licensing.md).


## Why use this tool?

- It relies mostly on sites like https://shields.io to generate professional badges that you can embed in your documentation and then add your own hyperlinks to.
- Great for new projects which have no badges yet, or updating older projects
- You don't need to learn the syntax for each badge type or worry about escaping a space character. The generator will save you time and give you just the markdown you need (you can also come back to the generator to regenerate a badge when you need to modify an existing badge).
- It aims to be more convenient and user-friendly than the generator on shields.io site.
- It focuses on the badge choices I commonly use and bundles the badges together as output, to avoid sifting through shields.io docs every time and to keep my projects looking consistent.
- Ideal for these topics:
    - JS, Python, Jekyll and Bash projects
    - Github Actions badges
    - Tags, license and Use this Template badges in the Github environment
- Need a badge which has custom text, color and URL? The generator can do that too.

_Note this project is work in progress and logic is being moved from the template to the generator_
