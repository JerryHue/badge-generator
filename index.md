> Generate tailor-made badges/shields for your repo docs and resources for learning to work with badges

## Why use this tool

- It relies mostly on https://shields.io for professional and widely-used badges
- You don't need to learn the syntax for each badge type or worry about escaping a space character. The generator will save you time and give you just the markdown you need (you can also come back to the generator to regenerate a badge when you need to modify an existing badge).
- It focus on a badges styles and syntax I commonly use and bundles the badges together in the output, to avoid sifting through shields.io docs every time and to keep my projects lookimg consistent
- Ideal for:
    - JS, Python, Jekyll and Bash projects
    - Github Actions and Netlify badges
    - Tags, license and template badges
- Need a badge which has custom text, color and URL? The generator can do that too.

_Note this project is work in progress and logic is being moved from the template to the generator_
